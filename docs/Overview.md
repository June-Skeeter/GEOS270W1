# Modules

Each module will be published as a webpage on github.  They will be made accessible through Canvas and will also be hyperlinked in the above schedule as they are posted.  Modules will have assessments associated with them that can be submitted via canvas.  Each module is a lesson intended to introduce and cover specific topics within GIS.

## Content

Module content will consist of readings, videos, & other materials pertaining to the topics outlined for each module.  **In person** lecture will be held **every** Wednesday (except September 8th) at 14:00 in room 200 of the Geography Building.
* The module content should be reviewed before in person lecture.  The schedule class time on Mondays at 14:00 will be a good time for this!
* In person lectures will cover the module content in depth and serve as your chance to ask questions and engage in discussion about the material.
  * In person lectures will be streamed and recorded for students who can not attend in person.  More details regarding streaming and recording will be avaliable soon!

## Application

The application will build on the module content and give you hands on practice working with GIS software.  You can work through the application in your lab section.  See the [Lab Access](/Labs.md) page for more details on specifics. 

## Assessment

Each assessment will will be due on the date listed in the [Course Schedule](#course-schedule).  The assessments will cover both lecture and lab material and will be submitted via canvas.  The assessments will consist of two parts:

### Automated Quizzes

Questions will consist of multiple choice, true/false, numeric input, and other questions that can be marked automatically.  You will be allowed multiple attempts to complete these quizzes, and you will receive a grade immediately after submission.  

### Marked Assignment

Marked assignments will be submitted via canvas quiz and be marked by your TA.  They will consist of written answers to questions as well as file sumbissions (maps/charts).

# Final Project

The final project will be assigned with Module 7.  The project is a group assignment that will be completed in groups of two to four.  You may only work on the project alone if you get approval.  GIS is a collaborative discipline and your project should be done with a group unless special circumstances necessitate otherwise.  More details will be provided later in the term.

---

# Final Exam

The final exam will be completed asynchronously over Canvas. It will be available for completion between December 13th and 15th.  It will consist of a few essays, short answers, a diagram, and a GIS task.  More details will be provided later in the term.
