The course is made up of eight modules that will be posted on the dates listed and a comprehensive final exam.  Each module will have three parts:
* **Content**: Readings, Videos, & Lecture
	* In person lectures for each module will be held Wednesdays at 14:00 in room 200 of the Geography Building on the dates listed.  The lectures will also be recorded and streamed on zoom for those who cannot attend in person.

* **Application**: Labs will build on the module content and give you hands on practice.
	* Labs associated with each module will take 1 or 2 weeks to complete.  See the [Lab Access](/Labs.md) page for more details on specifics. 

* **Assessment**: Each assessment will will be due on the specified date and have two parts: a Quiz and Assignment.  Both will be submitted on Canvas.  
	* Quizzes will consist of multiple choice, true/false, numeric input, and other questions that can be marked automatically.  Quizzes can be repeated (you'll have unlimited attempts).
	* Assignments will consist of write-ups and file submissions that cannot be marked automatically.  Assignments will be marked by your TA and returned with feedback within one week of the due date.
	* **Note** Quizzes and Assignments will be accepted up to one week after the due date without penalty.  **However** any assignments submitted after the due date waive their right to prompt turnaround or feedback.  When a late assignments will be marked will be left up to the discretion of your TA.  One week after the due date, assessments will be closed.  After which point you will need to email me to request access/accommodations.

I will hold weekly in person office hours after lecture on Wednesdays.  Zoom office hours will be available by appointment, requests must me made at least day in advance.  

## Course Evaluation

Modules 1-7 will each be worth 10% of your grade and the lowest score of modules 1-7 will be dropped.  Module 8 will be weighted more heavily because it contains the final project.  The final exam will be worth 15% of your grade.

| Points Distribution | Percent of Points |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Modules 1-7         | 60%               |
| Module 8            | 25%               |
| Final Exam          | 15%               |

## Accommodations

My aim for this semester is to be as flexible and supportive as possible while respecting my personal boundaries and those of the TAs.  Please contact the [Center for Accessibility](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility) if you require accommodations for a disability and make me aware any necessary accommodations by email in a timely manner.  If you require an [Academic Concession](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/degree-planning/academic-performance/academic-concession/) please email me promptly so that we can work together to figure out an accommodation that works for you.  You are not obligated to explain your personal circumstances to me to justify the concession.  If you require multiple concessions I may refer you to [Arts Advising](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/student-support/academic-support/academic-advising/). 

## Academic Integrity:

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.

Plagiarism and cheating will be taken very seriously.  The first incident of plagiarism/copying/cheating will result in a zero for the assignment.  Further incidents will be reported to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline in addition to a zero.

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found [here](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/academic-integrity/Links)
