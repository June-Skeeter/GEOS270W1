# Course Evaluation

Modules 1-7 will be weighted equally, module 8 will be weighted more heavily because it contains the final project.  The lowest scoring of Modules 1-7 will be dropped.  Assignments submitted by their due date will be marked and given feedback within 1 week.  There will be *no late penalties* for any assignments.  **However** assignments submitted after the due date are not entitled to prompt grading or feedback.  Depending on how late the submission is it may not be marked until the end of the semester and you may receive no feedback.  **No Submissions Will Be Accepted After the FInal Exam Date Without Prior Authorization**


| Points Distribution                    |      |

# Accommodations

My aim for this semester is to be as flexible and supportive as possible while respecting my personal boundaries and those of the TAs.  Please contact the [Center for Accessibility](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility) if you require accommodations for a disability and make me aware any necessary accommodations by email in a timely manner.  If you require an [Academic Concession](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/degree-planning/academic-performance/academic-concession/) please email me promptly so that we can work together to figure out an accommodation that works for you.  You are under no obligation explain your circumstances to me to justify the concession request.  Here is a template concession request:

	"Hi June,

If you request multiple concessions I will also refer you to [Arts Advising](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/student-support/academic-support/academic-advising/).
