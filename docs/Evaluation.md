## Course Evaluation

Modules 1-7 will be weighted equally, module 8 will be weighted more heavily because it contains the final project.  The lowest score of Modules 1-7 will be dropped.  Assignments submitted by their due date will be marked and given feedback within 1 week.  There will be *no late penalties* for any assignments.  **However** assignments submitted after the due date are not entitled to prompt grading or feedback.  Depending on how late the submission is it may not be marked until the end of the semester and you may receive no feedback.  **No Submissions Will Be Accepted After the FInal Exam Date Without Prior Authorization**

| Points Distribution | Percent of Points |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Modules 1-7         | 60%               |
| Module 8            | 25%               |
| Final Exam          | 10%               |

## Final Grade Distribution

As per Geography Department policy, at the end of term, final grades will be scaled to fit a [Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) with an average 72% with a standard deviation of 12%.  As such, your mark listed on canvas *will not* be reflective of you actual final grade in the class.  The approximate distribution of final grades in the course will be:

|Letter Grade|Percent Range|Percent of Total|
|------------|-------------|----------------|
|As          |80-100%      |25%             |
|Bs          |68-79%       |38%             |
|Cs          |55-67%       |29%             |
|Ds & Fs     |<= 54%       |8%              |

## Accommodations

My aim for this semester is to be as flexible and supportive as possible while respecting my personal boundaries and those of the TAs.  Please contact the [Center for Accessibility](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility) if you require accommodations for a disability and make me aware any necessary accommodations by email in a timely manner.  If you require an [Academic Concession](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/degree-planning/academic-performance/academic-concession/) please email me promptly so that we can work together to figure out an accommodation that works for you.  You are not obligated to explain your personal circumstances to me to justify the concession.  If you require multiple concessions I may refer you to [Arts Advising](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/student-support/academic-support/academic-advising/). 

## Academic Integrity:

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.

Plagiarism and cheating will be taken very seriously.  The first incident of plagiarism/copying/cheating will result in a zero for the assignment.  Further incidents will be reported to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline in addition to a zero.
