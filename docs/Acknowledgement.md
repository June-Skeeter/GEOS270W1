# First Nations Territories in BC

UBC and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples.  Specifically the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), əl̓ilwətaɁɬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh (Squamish) Nations.  There are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent.  To learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/).

# Why Do an Acknowledgement?

For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe.  In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada.  There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map.  Historically, maps have been used as tools of oppression and we must work to de-colonize our practices in GIS.  A land acknowledgement is one small way to help with that.  It isn't just a formality.  It is a time to reflect and build understanding.  

## What Does it Mean?

What do we mean when we say *traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory*?

### Traditional

Recognizes that the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied.  The [xʷməθkʷəy̓əm](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/x%ca%b7m%c9%99%ce%b8k%ca%b7%c9%99y%cc%93%c9%99m/) [əl̓ilwətaɁɬ](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/tsleil-waututh-s%c9%99l%cc%93ilw%c9%99ta%c9%82%c9%ac/), and [Skwxwú7mesh-ulh](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/skwxwu7mesh-uxwumixw/) Nations have traditionally occupied this area.

### Ancestral

Recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation.  It is meant to convey a deep rooted connection to the land.  Language has strong connections to ancestry.  The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of [Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/hulquminum-halqemeylem-h%c9%99n%cc%93q%cc%93%c9%99min%cc%93%c9%99m%cc%93/) and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak [Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/s%e1%b8%b5wx%cc%b1wu7mesh-snichim/).

### Unceded

Refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement.  Over 95% of the land in BC was never ceded by treaty.
