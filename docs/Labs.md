# Labs

A major part of your learning in this course is centered on the hands-on application of GIS.  As such, much or your time will be spent working on Application section of each Module.  Your weekly two hour lab is your chance to ask for help from your TA and work through the assignment with fellow classmates.  Lab 1A will meet synchronously on zoom, all others will meet in person at their scheduled times in room 115.  Lab attendance is strongly encouraged, but is not mandatory.  You must be registered for one of the following lab sections (all times in PDT/PST):

|Lab |           Time slot    | TA                        |Status                                                                                |
|----|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Labs will meet every week of term with the exception of Week 1 (Sept 6-10) and Week 10 (Nov 8-12).  The Lab section on Monday October 11th, will instead be hosted on alternative date that has yet to be determined.

# Your TA's 

There are two TAs for the class, who are will lead the lab sections listed above.  Please direct any email communication regarding assignments to your TA.

## Carla Urquhart

<img src="images/Carla.jpg" alt="hi" class="inline" width="300"/>

My name is Carla and my pronouns are she/her/hers.  You can reach me by email: carla.urquhart@ubc.ca  I'm a PhD student here in Geography. My research is in plant ecology and biogeography: I use computer models and experiments in the greenhouse to learn about how species evolve as they spread into new habitats. Besides that, I am a life-long Vancouverite, mum to a 6 year old kiddo named Alex (he/him) and kind of a nerd. I especially love sci-fi, RPGs and building computers.

## Mike Turley

<img src="images/Mike.jpg" alt="hi" class="inline" width="300"/>

My name is Mike  and my pronouns are he/him/his.  You can reach me by email:mbturley@student.ubc.ca  I am a Ph.D. student in the geography department interested in how landscapes respond to changing conditions such as glacier retreat. More specifically, I am trying to understand how connected or disconnected the landscape is in terms of material transfer (i.e., water, sediment, etc.), and how this changes over time. Outside of research, I am interested in backpacking, rafting, gravel biking, baking, and cartography.

# Software and computer access

To complete your lab assignments, you will be using ESRI's ArcGIS Pro.  This is a proprietary (costs money) program that can be operated on a desktop/laptop.  You have two options for accessing the software:

## Option 1: Geography Lab Computers ($20)

The Geography Department has computer labs that may be accessed in-person when the geography building is open and via remote desktop connection 24/7.  There is a $20 lab fee to use geography computers.  Every student will be assigned an account to access the Geography computer labs. You must [pay the lab fee](http://geog-epayment.sites.olt.ubc.ca/fees/geoglab-fees/) by ... insert deadline ... or your account will be locked.  After you pay the fee, email Jose Aparicio at: labhelp@geog.ubc.ca Jose will then send you your geography lab logon credentials.

If you need to remotely access lab computers, follow [these instructions](RemoteDesktop.pdf).

Information about the Geography Computer Labs can be found [here](https://geog.ubc.ca/undergraduate/study-resources/).  In particular, please refer the lab schedule and refrain from remotely logging into the lab computers while other courses are holding lab sessions.

## Option 2: Purchase a Student License ($30)

You may purchase a student version of the software to install on your own computer for $30.   
 you may use the computer labs in the Geography Department ($20 lab fee) or ($30).  ArcGIS Pro requires a PC (i.e. a computer running Windows) but if you have a Mac or Linux machine you can get around this by building a Windows partition on your hard drive or using a virtual machine.


To install ArcPro on your own computer:

If you have a Mac or Linux computer, you will first have to set up a Windows partition. You can [follow these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201468) **Unfortunately we cannot provide any support for this step of the installation.**
* Check that your computer meets the system requirements for ArcPro using [this link](http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/Client/Standard/?apikey=50F41142-39B0-4061-97C2-BA7B7FE43D0E&refid=1186&item=12433).
* [Head to](http://gis.ubc.ca/software/) to purchase, ArcGIS.  Important Note: ArcGIS Pro is not yet available for download directly from this site, only ArcMap.  Once you make the purchase, email your receipt to Jose Aparicio at: labhelp@geog.ubc.ca Jose will then send you a link to download ArcPro.


## Option 3: UBC Library GIS (Last Resort)

You can remote logon https://koerner.library.ubc.ca/blog/remote-access-to-koerner-labs/


# Saving Your Work

## On Geography Lab Computers

During your lab, you should save your work to C: \ temp. This is a folder stored locally on the computer you are working on.  Since it's the same machine you're working on, ArcGIS Pro can easily and quickly access and save files in this folder. However, lab computers are accessed by multiple users.  A single computer in room 115 might have 20-30 different students accessing it (in person or remotely) in a given week.  Each time a new user logs on, the C:/temp folder is at risk for being overwritten.  Therefore, it is **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** that you save your work elsewhere before you log off.  When you sign up for your Geography lab account, your account will be given server space, known as your H:/ drive folder; we recommend you save your work here. To do so, follow these steps:

* Save your Map document and close ArcGIS Pro or any other software you may be using (Word, Excel, e tc. ...)
* Launch My Computer, and navigate to C: \ temp
* From the top menu, Edit >Select All to select all files inside of C: \ temp
* From the top menu, Edit > Co py to Folder and select H: \ from the window. Click Copy

When you come back next time to complete the assignment, you will transfer the files in the reverse direction. This is because the H:/ drive is stored on a networked server, not the local machine, and so your machine would work very slowly if you try to work directly from the H:/ drive. To transfer your files:

* Log in
* Use My Computer to find C: \ temp and delete all the files you find there since they are most likely not yours
* Navigate to your H drive, select your current lab's folder , and copy it to C: \ temp
* Resume your work

Watch this video to see the steps you need to take when working with the geography labs.
