## Lab Access

A major part of your learning in this course apply GIScience to real-world data through your lab assignments. This page contains details about how to access the Labs how your labs will run. Please review it in detail!

You must be signed up for one of the following lab sections (all times in PDT/PST):

|Lab |           Time slot    | TA      |Status              |
|----|------------------------|---------|--------------------|
|L1A |Mondays 18:00-20:00     |Carla    |[On Zoom](link)     |
|L1B |Tuesdays 9:00-11:00     |Mike     |In-Person  (RM115)  |
|L1C |Tuesdays 16:00-18:00    |Mike     |In-Person  (RM115)  |
|L1D |Fridays 14:00-16:00     |Carla    |In-Person  (RM115)  |


Lab 1A will meet synchronously on zoom, all others will meet in person at their scheduled times in room 115.  Lab attendance is strongly encouraged, but is not mandatory.  During the two hour lab periods, you will work on the lab assignment and have the opportunity to ask questions to your fellow classmates and TAs.

Labs will meet every week of term with the exception of Week 1 (Sept 6-10) and Week 10 (Nov 8-12).  The Monday Lab section on Monday October 11th, will instead be hosted on [Ask Carla for alternate time/date & consult schedule]

Though you may work together with your classmates on the assignments and help each other, ALL STUDENTS MUST SUBMIT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK. This means that your maps must be your own, and your answers must be in your own words. Failure to submit your own work can result in failing the assignment or worse, so please be careful. See the Academic Integrity section of the Syllabus for more information.

For help when you get stuck, here are some additional resources: [ESRI Technical Support](https://support.esri.com/en), [Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/), and [Google](https://www.google.com/).

Software and computer access:

You will be using ESRI's ArcGIS Pro software to complete your lab assignments. You have multiple options for accessing the software: you may use the computer labs in the Geography Department ($20 lab fee), or you may purchase a student version of the software to install on your own computer ($30).  ArcGIS Pro requires a PC (i.e. a computer running Windows) but if you have a Mac or Linux machine you can get around this by building a Windows partition on your hard drive or using a virtual machine. 

To install ArcPro on your own computer:

If you have a Mac or Linux computer, you will first have to set up a Windows partition. You can [follow these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201468) **Unfortunately we cannot provide any support for this step of the installation.**
* Check that your computer meets the system requirements for ArcPro using [this link](http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/Client/Standard/?apikey=50F41142-39B0-4061-97C2-BA7B7FE43D0E&refid=1186&item=12433).
* [Head to](http://gis.ubc.ca/software/) to purchase, ArcGIS.  Important Note: ArcGIS Pro is not yet available for download directly from this site, only ArcMap.  Once you make the purchase, email your receipt to Jose Aparicio at: labhelp@geog.ubc.ca Jose will then send you a link to download ArcPro.

To use Geography computer lab machines:

You will receive an account to access the Geography computer labs through Canvas. You must [pay the lab fee](http://geog-epayment.sites.olt.ubc.ca/fees/geoglab-fees/) by ... insert deadline ... or your account will be locked.  After you pay the fee, email Jose Aparicio at: labhelp@geog.ubc.ca Jose will then send you your geography lab logon credentials.

If you need to remotely access lab computers, follow [these instructions](RemoteDesktop.pdf).

Information about the Geography Computer Labs can be found [here](https://geog.ubc.ca/undergraduate/study-resources/).  In particular, please refer the lab schedule and refrain from remotely logging into the lab computers while other courses are holding lab sessions.

How to save and store your work on the Geography lab computers:
During your lab, you should save your work to C: \ temp. This is a folder stored locally on the computer you are working on. Since it's the same machine you're working on, ArcGIS Pro can easily and quickly access and save files in this folder. However, these computers are used by multiple users, and each time a new user logs on, the C:/temp folder is at risk for being overwritten. Therefore, it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you save your work elsewhere before you log off. When you sign up for your Geography lab account, you will be given space on the Geography server, known as your H:/ drive folder; we recommend you save your work here. To do so, follow these steps:

* Save your Map document and close ArcGIS Pro or any other software you may be using (Word, Excel, e tc. ...)
* Launch My Computer, and navigate to C: \ temp
* From the top menu, Edit >Select All to select all files inside of C: \ temp
* From the top menu, Edit > Co py to Folder and select H: \ from the window. Click Copy

When you come back next time to complete the assignment, you will transfer the files in the reverse direction. This is because the H:/ drive is stored on a networked server, not the local machine, and so your machine would work very slowly if you try to work directly from the H:/ drive. To transfer your files:

* Log in
* Use My Computer to find C: \ temp and delete all the files you find there since they are most likely not yours
* Navigate to your H drive, select your current lab's folder , and copy it to C: \ temp
* Resume your work
