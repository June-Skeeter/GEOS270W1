Hi folks, my name is June Skeeter and my pronouns are they/them/theirs.  You can reach me by email: skeeter1@mail.ubc.ca  I am a non-binary geographer and educator with a passion for social and ecological justice.  I use GIS extensively is my research studying climate change in the Arctic and more recently, I've started using GIS to investigate police violence in Canada.  I've been teaching GIS for six years, first as a TA and now as an instructor.  My aim in teaching this course is to show people how to use GIS as a tool to help make the world a better place.  When I'm not working, I like to spend my free time hiking, snowboarding, baking, and gardening.

My name is Carla and my pronouns are she/her/hers.  You can reach me by email: carla.urquhart@ubc.ca  I'm a PhD student here in Geography. My research is in plant ecology and biogeography: I use computer models and experiments in the greenhouse to learn about how species evolve as they spread into new habitats. Besides that, I am a life-long Vancouverite, mum to a 6 year old kiddo named Alex (he/him) and kind of a nerd. I especially love sci-fi, RPGs and building computers.

My name is Mike  and my pronouns are he/him/his.  You can reach me by email:mbturley@student.ubc.ca  I am a Ph.D. student in the geography department interested in how landscapes respond to changing conditions such as glacier retreat. More specifically, I am trying to understand how connected or disconnected the landscape is in terms of material transfer (i.e., water, sediment, etc.), and how this changes over time. Outside of research, I am interested in backpacking, rafting, gravel biking, baking, and cartography.
