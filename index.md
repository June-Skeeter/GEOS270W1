My name is June Skeeter, I am a white settler and immigrant from the United States who has been living as an univited guest unceded Coast Salish Territory for six years.  I am non-binary and my pronouns are they/them/theirs.  I am a geographer, researcher, and educator with a passion for social and ecological justice.  My principal aim this semester is to providing a holistic introduction to the study of Geographic Information Science and application of Geographic Information Systems.

I've been teaching GIS for six years, first as a TA and now as an instructor.  My aim in teaching this course is to show people how to use GIS as a tool to help make the world a better place.  When I'm not working, I like to spend my free time hiking, snowboarding, baking, and gardening.  I use GIS extensively is my research studying climate change in the Arctic.  More recently, I've started using GIS to [track police violence in Canada](https://policeinvolveddeathsincanada.github.io/DataSets/).
