# Learning Outcomes

This course will expose you to key concepts and tools used to collect, map, and interpret geographic data.  We will learn how geospatial data can be used to aid decision-making, complement scientific analysis, assist with urban planning, and help inform policy-making.  You will gain practical experience using geospatial data to solve problems in both the natural and human realms.  This term we will cover:

* How GIS functions and how it can be applied to solve problems.
* How phenomena are represented as geospatial data in a GIS.
* How to implement geospatial analysis methods.
* Visualizing geospatial data and principles of good map design. 
* Sources of error in GIS analysis and output.
* The ethical implications of GIS analysis.
* GIS workflows and collaborating to complete a GIS project.

# Your Instructor

My name is June Skeeter, I am a white settler and immigrant from the United States who has been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory for six years.  I am non-binary and my pronouns are they/them/theirs.  I am a geographer, researcher, and educator with a passion for social and ecological justice.

## My Research

I use GIS extensively is my research studying [climate change in the Arctic](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/4421/2020/bg-17-4421-2020.html).  More recently, I've started using GIS to [track police violence in Canada](https://police-involved-deaths-ca.github.io/Data/).  When I'm not working, I like to spend my free time hiking, snowboarding, baking, and gardening.
