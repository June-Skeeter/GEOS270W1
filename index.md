## Learning Outcomes

This course will expose you to key concepts and tools used to collect, map, and interpret geographic data.  We will learn how geospatial data can be used to aid decision-making, complement scientific analysis, assist with urban planning, and help inform policy-making.  You will gain practical experience using geospatial data to solve problems in both the natural and human realms.  This term we will cover:

* How GIS functions and how it can be applied to solve problems.
* How phenomena are represented as geospatial data in a GIS.
* How to implement geospatial analysis methods.
* Visualizing geospatial data and principles of good map design. 
* Sources of error in GIS analysis and output.
* The ethical implications of GIS analysis.
* GIS workflows and collaborating to complete a GIS project.

My name is June Skeeter, I am a white settler and immigrant from the United States who has been living on unceded Coast Salish Territory for six years.  I am non-binary and my pronouns are they/them/theirs.  I am a geographer, researcher, and educator with a passions for gardening, hiking, and baking.  My principal aim this semester is to providing a holistic introduction to the study of Geographic Information Science and application of Geographic Information Systems.

I've been teaching GIS for six years, first as a TA and now as an instructor.  My aim in teaching this course is to show people how to use GIS as a tool to help make the world a better place.  When I'm not working, I like to spend my free time hiking, snowboarding, baking, and gardening.  I use GIS extensively is my research studying climate change in the Arctic.  More recently, I've started using GIS to [track police violence in Canada](https://policeinvolveddeathsincanada.github.io/DataSets/).  

You can reach me by email (skeeter1@mail.ubc.ca) or come to my office hours (Wednesdays after lecture, or Thursdays 1:00 room 144).  I'm also available for office hours via zoom by appointment.
