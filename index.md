# Geographic Information Science

## Course Overview:

This course will expose you to key concepts and tools used to collect, map, and interpret geographic data.  We will learn how geospatial data can be used to aid decision-making, complement scientific analysis, assist with urban planning, and help inform policy-making.  You will gain practical experience using geospatial data to solve problems in both the natural and human realms.

## Land Acknowledgement

The UBC Geography department is on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), səl̓ilwətaɁɬ təməxʷ (Tsleil-Waututh), Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Temíx̱w (Squamish) Nations.  This data is from [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/).  It is by no means a definitive source, but it's a good place to start building an understanding of the Indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.
